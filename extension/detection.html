            <p class="info2">We have identified a potential deepfake in the video you are watching. Below you can see
                our
                anylsis of the video. We have displayed the exact frame on where our neural network detected the
                deepfake.
                We have also given the probability of the video being a deepfake. Keep in mind it may not be 100%
                accurate, and
                if you know for sure it is not a deepfake please ignore and close this popup.</p>
